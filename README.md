# APIDiveSite
By Gilles Gaubert



I borrowed the data from the internet (25 BEST DIVE SITES IN THE WORLD TO PUT ON YOUR BUCKET LIST)... to create a simplistic API REST as a tool to learn nodejs and its integration in Heroku in a fun way.





Model for the data used :

id
location
divesite
maxDepth
minLevel
comments
otherds

Example in json : 

[
{"id":"1","location":"Taveuni, Fiji","divesite":"Great White Wall","maxDepth":"40","minLevel":"Experienced","comments":"The locals have done a great job in protecting the local reefs. As a result, you’ll see thousands of species of coral and marine life. At the Great White Wall, you’ll start off by swimming through a cave then see a hill of what seemingly looks white with coral descending into the depths. Also, keep you eye out for batfish and barracuda that frequent the area.","otherds":""},
